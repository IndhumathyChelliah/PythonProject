Generators:
===========

1. yield-> yield a value and keep the state. return will return the result. 
return will terminate the function. yeild wont

2. we can have more number of yield in a function.

3. generator function yeilds an iterator.

4. yield is a special function which makes the function as a generator.

5. adv: Performance and memory usage

If u read ahuge csv file, u may get memory errors. you have to use generator at that time.

generator function produce result only when they needed.

1. generator function returns an iterator. you can iterate through iteretor in following ways:

a) using next()
b) converting to list using list()
c) using for loop

disadvantage: takes more time 

generator expressions:
======================
list comprehension (change the [ ]to ( )) -> is called generator expression.
it will return generator object


generator:

yield a vlaue.
save state 
exit
