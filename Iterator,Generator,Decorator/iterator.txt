Iterator protocols:
==================


__iter__()

__next__()


iterables => list,tuples,string

Iterables converted to iterated using iter

iterator knows its state and know how to get the next value

iterator object can only go forward. no backward, no resetting, no making copy of it.

if u need from scratch u hv to create another iterator object.


l1=[1,2,3,4]

l2=iter(l1)

print (next(l2))

iterator can keep on going and u can get one value at a time.
